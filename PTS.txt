Notes:
1. Reduce dependence of human for delivery
2. Tube size is 110mm/160mm(4inches or 6inches)
3. VFD is used in Side channel Blower
4. Bottom channel introducer has a touch screen(Maybe through a phone or diff touch component) at that component
5. PAss through system is a receiving end of the Carrier in the tube system
6. Buffer is used in Imp situation. 
7. 1 zone system is implemented in the project.
8. The system is designed to be modular and scalable.
9. 
Functional req.
1. Maintaince is imp.(velcro in the capsule, leaks in the tube,etc)
2.  modular approach for the setup in a station

Meet 2:(07-11-2024)
->Only passthrought station is used for the entire project(Maybe a bottom loading station implemented later)
->FOCUS on Passthrought station 
->4 lateral sensors + 2 sensors on the pipe + 1 (Capacitive proximity sensor)(EC)
->for Carrier diverter(there is a motor to rotate the tube)
->Proximity Sensor(given one) is a temporary sensor.(EC)
-> 7 floors(7 PassThrought station) are implemented in the present project
->24V for the power supply
->Pipes should be straight(ADD JOINTS to the pipes)
CS:
->Make to models to the components
->Give to functionality for each component
->Make real time simulation 
->Buffer Component is ending point. will be added between stations 
->Emergency Button to route the Imediate Item in the capsule 
->One more DB for path;
->Staff can see everything except path
->Provide a zoom function in canvas and a Cartian plane(for diff floors and diff buildings(All Labeled)) in canvas
